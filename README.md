# Python Keylogger

This is a simple Python-based keylogger that logs keystrokes to a text file. The keylogger is lightweight and logs all keys pressed on the keyboard.

## Features
- Logs all keystrokes to a file.
- Handles special characters like Enter, Space, Shift, and Control.

## Installation
To set up and run the keylogger, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PehanIn/key-logger.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

3. Run the keylogger:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. The logs will be saved in `log.txt` in the same directory as the script.

## Future Improvements
- **Email logs**: Add functionality to send logs via email at regular intervals.
- **Screenshot capture**: Optionally capture screenshots to monitor visual context.
